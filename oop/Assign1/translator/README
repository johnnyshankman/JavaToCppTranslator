******* THE TEAM *******

1. Put all java files in xtc/src/oop

2. While in the src/oop directory run these commands ONCE to forever patch xtc.lang's JavaExternalAnalyzer to run  with our program:

    $ make patchxtc

    Then these commands to cleanly recompile xtc with the new patch:

    $ cd ../..
    $ make clean
    $ make
    $ cd src/oop

3. To run the translation program on our test files use the following command (replace # with a number):

    $ java oop.Translate -translate Tests/Test#.java

4. Translated files can be found in the directory src/oop/cplusplusfiles
