Put all java files in xtc/src/oop

While in the src/oop directory

Run 'make' command to compile everything.

To run the translation program on our test file use the following command:

~$ java oop.Translate -translate Test.java



The output is mostly debugging from CppPrinter to make sure our C++ AST is working correctly at the moment.

We're working on getting the pretty printing together.
